# Infuseth-ink Hub
Tickets to track progress of work across repos.

One stop shop (a.k.a. _"issue repo"_) for:
- epics, features, user stories, and tasks....and bug reports
- Wiki that applies to the entire organization or project
  - Repos can have their own wikis, e.g. backend for backend-specific internals
- This repo is not meant for code

## Conventions
- all repos must have a prefix, e.g.:
  - `infusethin-frontend`, not just `frontend`, since we might create another product that has its own frontend, backend, IaC, etc.
  - the prefix does not need to be the org name

## Inspirations
